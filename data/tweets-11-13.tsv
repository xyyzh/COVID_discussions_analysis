First of all, the adenovirus vector vaccines (AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson, Sputnik V) are 'live' viruses. Secondly, read about the similarities between messenger RNA, mitochondrial RNA, and viroids (unencapsulated viruses). This is a touchy subject here.

Soon everyone will need a third so-called 'booster' shot. Then a 4th &amp; so on, until the vaccines don't do anything anymore. And no one knows if each shot will cause &amp; accumulate long-term harm. Nobody knows!

We're only in this mess because people are deciding to not get a free, readily available vaccine...and a lot of people who made that decision have died because of it. \n\nYou're free to make the decision, doesn't mean there's no consequences.

First off, vaccines are the most researched vaccines in history. Extremely safe and very effective. More than a billion ppl have taken them. There is much less evidence for Invermectin and Covid.

Our developed nations have purchased an excess of vaccines which are just going to be trashed if we don't use them. The fewer people who get COVID, the safer we all are. Still wish that a LOT more of them were going to developing countries.

Is that weird? In compliance?
