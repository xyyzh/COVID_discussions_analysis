We aren't every eliminating it, and vaccination keeps you out of hospital. Focus on vaccination and quit trying to stop transmission.

A vaccine fundamentally CANNOT provide better immunity for ANY disease. Vaccine's goal by design is to present the body with a substance that resembles the pathogen as close as possible. Such presentation cannot exceed the model (pathogen) itself.

But you can get the food there and sit or stand anywhere else in the mall. There are benches everywhere or just sit on the floor.

Smoking is a physical and chemical addiction… how does that relate to vaccination in anyway?

My kids can't even take a ball out to play at recess, and wind up rough housing out of boredom..inevitably getting into trouble or hurt..not ok!

Thats not changing anything, youre wrong. There was an different mrna vaccine tested in 2017 on humans, by your logic we can say mrna vaccines have years of testing. Right?
