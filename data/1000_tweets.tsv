We aren't every eliminating it, and vaccination keeps you out of hospital. Focus on vaccination and quit trying to stop transmission.

A vaccine fundamentally CANNOT provide better immunity for ANY disease. Vaccine's goal by design is to present the body with a substance that resembles the pathogen as close as possible. Such presentation cannot exceed the model (pathogen) itself.

But you can get the food there and sit or stand anywhere else in the mall. There are benches everywhere or just sit on the floor.

They have told you want you temporarily can’t do, work, travel etc and as I’ve said as long as the gov maintains these as temporary measures, section 1 supersedes any other Charter sections. It’s a garbage document.

Reminder, the vaccine coverage you need in a population is directly related to the RECIPROCAL of the virus' reproductive number R. So if delta has R of 8, you don't approach herd immunity without getting to 1-1/R, near 90%.

The issue is how much, how serious, &amp; what is the benefit in tradeoff? Pls share your international data that demonstrates greater harm than risk. If I were cherry picking, scientific consensus wouldn't favor vaccination in kids.

At this point, it's irrelevant and frankly a distraction from the core issues. What's more important is that you are speaking out about the harms of coercion, vaccine mandates and vaccine passports. Bodily autonomy is a right.

What concerns me is the vaccines we've been given during the stated emergency have not been fully proven. I don't get why they are pushed so hard. And, I note that the companies that make them have a VERY dodgy record.

The original statement was that 40% of Covid deaths in Ontario are in the vaccinated. Where is the evidence for that when the stats show that the vast majority of serious covid cases are among the unvaccinated?

From the little bit of testing and tracing that we do with vaccinated close contacts we only found 6 locations with exposures that occurred over a period of hours where proof of vaccination is required. Covid spread only happening in faith gatherings.

Get the vaccine eat properly exercise and take your tiny blue pill that was tested on rats
