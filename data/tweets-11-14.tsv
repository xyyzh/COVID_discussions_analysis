That means, no dropping of mandates, boosters approved asap, robust suppy of vaccine for kids for those who want it, etc.

Both have better protection against covid especially the delta version and less potential risks compared to AZ.  I‚Äôm surprised they are offering boosters that are AZ.

By itself, it has no effect on viruses.\n\nInstead, it teaches your immune cells to be bouncers that thump bad viruses once they get in and try making trouble. If your ‚Äúbouncers‚Äù aren‚Äôt numerous enough, you can still get sick.

Educate yourself.

Those exposures happened days ago to over a week ago. Very concerning considering that they reduced the testing and tracing in the vaccinated and they are taking this long to find the exposures.

The vaccinated can still get C19, it‚Äôs more likely to get it from someone unvaccinated. The vaccine is not 100% protection, but it has been proven to better your chances and keep you out of the hospital. Therefore the vaccinated are not a strain on the healthcare system.

We know that for the fully vaccinated, ICU hospitalization and death are as rare as with the flu. \n\nThe point of mass vaccination was to stop the health care systems from being overwhelmed by COVID deaths not to stop every single person from ever testing positive.

Actual antivaxxer I had an argument with said covid fatality rate is 0.01 percent which is false. Pro vaxxer told me covid fatality rate is worse then smallpox fatality rate.. which by the way has a 30 percent fatality rate.

Reminder, the vaccine coverage you need in a population is directly related to the RECIPROCAL of the virus' reproductive number R. So if delta has R of 8, you don't approach herd immunity without getting to 1-1/R, near 90%.

No vaccine is 100% effective, so sometimes people who were vaccinated got measles anyway at its typical severity. It's of course reasonable to presume that if not for the vaccination the case may be more severe but we can't know for sure.

The first two doses are wasted if people get sick because they didn't get the third dose.\n\nAnd I am increasingly concerned that hospitalization may not be the best metric for judging this virus. Long covid may end up being the worst part of it.

There are risks taking the vaccine or not, but taking it is a MEASURABLE protection to prevent wartime hospital collapse.
