They still provide immunity by allowing the body to create antibodies without actually getting infected. This means survival chances go up, infection windows go down, but infection and death remain possible, just less likely.

Furthermore, it would be very unsafe for Canadians, if worldwide travelers would enter without being tested first.\nThis may lead to covid cases, shutdown of the entire country, and so forth. So No!

The two approaches are complementary, not exclusive.

Look it up. If you understand how a vaccine works you wouldn't need to be online arguing against them. The evidence is well established and overwhelming as it's over a century of evidence vs 1 year.

That means, no dropping of mandates, boosters approved asap, robust suppy of vaccine for kids for those who want it, etc.

The vaccinated can still get C19, it‚Äôs more likely to get it from someone unvaccinated. The vaccine is not 100% protection, but it has been proven to better your chances and keep you out of the hospital. Therefore the vaccinated are not a strain on the healthcare system.

Greatly reducing or eliminating a disease is done by slowing the spread enough that it dies out. With the Delta variant, that's going to require more people getting vaccinated.

My whole point is not against taking the vaccine, it's about not needing to take the vaccine if you've been infected previously. If it's all about protecting others, then Antigen tests should be as valid as vax cards.

Giving vaccinations is a basic service in primary care. Doctors now can give all vaccinations to patients EXCEPT for COVID ones. This makes no sense.

All these countries have strict mask mandates, including in schools. Vaccination in children is reasonably high.

Government is waiting until 85% of all Canadians have both doses to activate it.  It's widely circulated that this will be activated ince the next election is called.  Also, all votes will be liberal.

Nobody is allowed to question anything about any of this, which should worry everyone.

The first two doses are wasted if people get sick because they didn't get the third dose.\n\nAnd I am increasingly concerned that hospitalization may not be the best metric for judging this virus. Long covid may end up being the worst part of it.

There are risks taking the vaccine or not, but taking it is a MEASURABLE protection to prevent wartime hospital collapse. If you trust your immune system to fight covid, you should be forced to trust it to fight everything else !!
