# Introduction

In this project, our objective was to understand recent discussions around COVID-19 in Canadian social media. In particular, we were interested in the salient topics about COVID-19 and what each topic primarily concerns, relative engagement with these topics, and the sentiment in response to the pandemic or vaccination. 


Our analysis drew on Twitter posts, or tweets. We collected 1,000 unique English tweets within a three-day window, filtering by the contents that mentioned certain keywords such as “vaccine” and “pfizer”. We conducted an open coding on 200 tweets and developed eight topics, namely “mandate”, “efficacy”, “unvax”, “political”, “side\_effect”,  “information”, “children”, and “spread”. We manually annotated each tweet with one of these topics, as well as with a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. 


With fully annotated 1,000 tweets in our dataset, we computed the ten words in each topic with the highest TF-IDF scores, and conducted further analysis to gain better insight on the Twitter climate surrounding COVID-19 and pandemic measures. 


The amount of positive and negative sentiments across all tweets in the dataset are balanced with a slight skew for the positive. The positive sentiments mainly come from the categories “unvax” and “spread”. However, the top two categories with the most relative engagement are “mandate” and “efficacy” are mainly leaning towards negative sentiments rather than positive. Although there is more of a positive sentiment across the entire dataset, Twitter users ultimately interact with categories that have more negative attitudes, thus promoting vaccine hesitancy on the social media platform nonetheless.
