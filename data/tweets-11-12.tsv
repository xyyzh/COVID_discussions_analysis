I've seen the vaccine adjusted rates across the age bands. This is entirely caused those who refused, are truly exempt, or are currently ineligible for the vaccine. \n\nVermont's vaccine uptake is lower than Ontario's btw.

This means survival chances go up, infection windows go down, but infection and death remain possible, just less likely.

Furthermore, it would be very unsafe for Canadians, if worldwide travelers would enter without being tested first.\nThis may lead to covid cases, shutdown of the entire country, and so forth. So No!

Since a virus has the potential to grow exponentially and infections are unidentified for some time after they occur, it's very impt to look at  growth rates - where things will be, not where they were.

It is the one thing I can say that our Manitoba government got right. I suspect it had more to do with the people in charge of the vaccine roll out than the actual government. I could totally see @jossreimer making a very good case for it.

There's no way that the Canadian government is going to share their vaccine wealth so the doses will just be garbage if we don't use them. It's allowing me to attend a few in-person activities with a feeling of security.

Maybe if the provincial gov't got theirüí©together and not change the guidelines every week. Make up your damn mine. Also, maybe wear a mask while doing the announcement to reinforce the idea of masks

Also has an adjuvant (to aid/enhance the immune response).

Fully vaxxed against covid and even went for a flu shot this year. Not taking chances while preggo. So glad my local gov revoked letting covid+ ppl in the delivery rooms...

Quit reducing the number of ICU beds. Start increasing care capabilities seen as it was an issue BEFORE covid and now you're passing the buck onto non-vaccinated Albertans for a problem our own gov caused yrs ago.

Of course you have to actually get covid to get this immunity.
